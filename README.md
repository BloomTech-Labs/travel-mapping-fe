Piktorlog is an app that allows you to organize your photos in any way that you choose. Whether it is by date, subject, or theme, you can organize your photos in the way that works best for you. 

Piktorlog also lets you invite collaborators to upload their photos to an album of your choosing, so you don't have to track down photos from event participants.


### 4️⃣ Key Features

### Basic Features
- Ability to upload photos
    - Metadata fields for photo (user input)
        - Title
        - Captions
    - Default metadata fields as determined by user
- Ability to tag/classify photos according a user-defined category; photos can belong to multiple categories)
    - Categories could be things like: 
        - Event (Birthday, Holiday), location, People, year, subject (e.g. art or books)
- Search/filter by category/categories
- Ability to invite collaborators/have multiple authorized users for an album


## 1️⃣ Tech Stack

### Front end built using:
- React 
- Redux
- Semantic UI

#### Front-End Considerations

1. What Framework are you using for your FE? (React, React Native, Angular, Vue, etc...)
React (consider possibly using React Native for dedicated mobile app if time-frame allows). 

2. What alternatives were considered?
GatsbyJS, Vue, Next.js

3. Why did you decide on this framework over the alternatives (what are the advantages?)
We decided on this framework based on the knowledge base of the developers on the project. Semantic UI was something new for most of us involved in the product. 

4. What potential challenges can you foresee using this framework?
State management, scalability, authentication, front-endtesting (React testing library)


#### Front end deployed to `netlify.com`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/travel-mapping-be/) built using:
- Node.js

#### Back-End

1. What Framework are you using for your BE? 
We went with Node.JS given the technical skillset of the developers involved.

2. What alternatives were considered?
GraphQL

3. Why did you decide on this framework over the alternatives (what are the advantages?)
We decided on this framework based on the knowledge base of the developers on the project. GraphQL although promising is too new and too untested.

4. What potential challenges can you foresee using this framework?
Scalability (what happens if we have multiple or millions of requests); error handling; offline functionality

# APIs

## 2️⃣ Authentication API here

We went with JWT. 

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

We also decided to use Cloudinary for image hosting. 

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dbl8pi1ms
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=584833961342644
CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY=NShFaw7fvrlsCAqzfEh9MObgzNE
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://piktorlog.com/api

## Documentation

See [Backend Documentation]() for details on the backend of our project.


## Open Questions: 
- What do we do in light of recent privacy concerns, e.g. "Right to be Forgotten" and California's recent actions on privacy? See [Release Canvas 1.2 Features]() for more information.
- What do we offer in terms of unique value propositon with regard to Google/Apple? How much can we really sell people on collaboration and custom organization?
- We did some rudimentary front-end testing by building special front-end components to feed mock data, but we could have actually deployed a real testing suite.
