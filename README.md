Media Organizer is an app that allows you to organize your photos in any way that you choose. Whether it is by date, subject, or theme, you can organize your photos in the way that works best for you. 

Media organizer also lets you invite collaborators to upload their photos, so you don't have to track down photos from event participants.


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features

### Basic Features
- Ability to upload photos
    - Metadata fields for photo (user input)
        - Title

- Search/filter by category/categories
- Ability to invite collaborators/have multiple authorized users for an album
    - Ability to assign permissions to collaborators
